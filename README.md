# Advanced State Management - The Reducer Pattern

## Requirements

- Node 16.x
- NPM 8.x (update NPM executing `npm i -g npm`)
- Chrome >= 100.x

Other browser/Node/NPM configurations might work but haven't been tested.

## Scripts

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run ketchup`

## Set Up

- Clone and `npm install`. DO NOT FORK! (Or the "ketchup" script won't work.)
- Launch the project on a development server executing `npm run dev`.
- Visit your app by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` with Chrome.
- Reset to the instructor's remote branch executing `npm run ketchup`.
